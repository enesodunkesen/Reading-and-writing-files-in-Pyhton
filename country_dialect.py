    # That works and is often a quick way to read a CSV file that uses a different separator.

    # You can't examine each file yourself, to check things like the separators being used.
    # We need an automated solution. The CSV module's Sniffer class can help here.
    # It examines a sample of the file, and works out things like the separators, the character
    # used to delimit strings, and so on. It uses that sample to create a Dialect.
    # A Dialect is just all of the various options, grouped together into a single object.

    # We obtained the sample by reading the entire countries_data2 file. (That's not the most efficient way)

    # Because we've read the entire file, there's nothing left for the reader to read. We've reached the end of the file
    # The seek method is used to position the file pointer to another place in the file.

# That's obviously not very efficient, especially with very large files.
# The sniffer only needs a sample of the data. Generally, two or three lines should be sufficient
# When you checked out the documentation for the read and readline methods, you'll have seen the size parameter.
# You can tell both methods how many characters to read (to create a sample for passing as an argument to sniff method)
