    # The next step is to read the data from the stream that we've opened, and decode it from UTF-8:
    # Our original line 6, which is now commented out, specified the encoding when we opened the file.
    # The urlopen function doesn't let us specify an encoding, so we decode the data after reading that's on line 9.

    # of reading the data from a file. We've read the data on line 9,and now have a string containing the JSON.
    # json.load gets data from a file â€“ as we've seen.Similarly, json.dump sends data to a file.
    # There are 2 other functions, corresponding to these,that take or return a string. The names are almost the same, they just end in "s".
