# Serialization is the process of converting an object or data structure into a format that can be easily stored,
# transmitted, or reconstructed at a later time. The serialized form is typically a stream of bytes or a string
# that can be written to a file, sent over a network, or stored in a database.
# json(javascript object notation) is such a format, plus it's a standard for serialization
